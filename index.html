          <h1>Leadership effectiveness & adaptability description</h1>
          <p>
            Assume you are the leader in each of the following twelve
            situations. Read each item carefully and think about what you would
            do in each. Select the option you think would most closely describe
            your behaviour in the situation presented.
          </p>
          <p>
            For each situation, think of yourself in your leadership role at
            work / on site. For example, suppose an item mentions team members,
            then think about your staff as your team members
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Do not change</strong> your situation from one item to
            another. You can complete the questionnaire several times, if you
            wish to examine your leadership behaviour in as many different
            settings or situations as you think helpful.

            <p>
              Your dominant leadership style is defined as the quadrant in which
              most of your responses fall. Your supporting style (or styles) is
              the style that you tend to use on some occasions only. The
              percentage of responses in Quadrants other than your dominant
              style suggest the number and degree of your supporting styles. 17%
              in a quadrant is necessary for that style to be considered a
              supporting style.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your dominant style plus your supporting styles determines your
              style. In essence, this is the extent to which you perceive your
              ability to use your leadership style.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your style range can be analysed by examining the quadrants in
              which responses fall, and by the percentage in each quadrant. If
              responses fall in only one quadrant, then you perceive yourself as
              having a limited range of leadership behaviour; if your responses
              are distributed fairly evenly, you perceive yourself as having a
              wide range of leadership behaviour.
            </p>
            <p>
              Research indicates that skilful leaders are perceived by their
              team members to have a wide range of leadership behaviour, and
              sensitivity in the range of which behaviour to use in any given
              situation.
